grml-debootstrap (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  The "thanks to gebi for the bugreports and feedback" release. :)
  * Install busybox in kernel stage to be able to debug initramfs
    problems.
  * Check whether we are installing into a directory in stage mkfs
    so we don't skip if the target is already mounted.
  * Mention "default: lenny" instead of "default: stable" in help
    text as "stable" is invalid.
  * Use 'pri=0' as example for swap partition in /etc/fstab.
  * Do not adjust mydestination and myhostname in /etc/postfix/main.cf as
    mydestination defaults to "$myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost",
    myhostname defaults to gethostname() and mydomain to localdomain.
  * Slightly improve wording of -t and -p options.
  * Do not try to create /etc/debootstrap if it already exists (which
    might be the case when installing to a directory).
  * Mention hostname in configuration check dialog.
  * Apply patch by Zoran Dzelajlija which addresses the partition
    calculation problem when installing to /dev/cciss/c0d0*. Thanks!

    have '/dev/md*' in the interactive partition dialog.
  * Do not display mountpoint if we are using the default one.
  * Avoid duplicate 'Running ... on a directory, nothing to mount.'
    message.
  * Do not continue execution if provided mirror doesn't work.

grml-debootstrap (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features:
    - support setting Debian suite components (like main, contrib,...)
      through COMPONENTS so it's possible to use a simple 'main' mirror.
    - support setting aptitude/apt-get options through $DPKG_OPTIONS.
    - support selection of netinstall vs. local mirror in interactive menu
  * Bugfixes:
    - make sure to ignore /dev/md* devices if not using SW-RAID
    - do not fail in chrootmirror() when using $ISO variable.
    - change order of checkconfiguration() so we get the prompt/
      display for checking configuration again.
    - Drop 'do not prompt for partition dialog if swraid has been
      configured already' which doesn't make any sense in most situations
  * Minor changes:
    - check for mounted target in mkfs() step already instead of mount_target()
    - use '.. to the debootstrap command' in description of --debopt
    - chroot-script: put installation of kernel before installing additional
      packages so installation of kernel doesn't fail if the kernel directory
      exists already
  * Debian Package:
    - bump Standard Version to 3.8.1 (no further changes).

      [Closes: issue518]
    - support DEBOOTSTRAP_OPT for passing extra parameters to the
      debootstrap command
    - support KEEP_SRC_LIST to allow user to provide their
      own apt sources.list from /etc/debootstrap/etc/apt/sources.list
    - provide cmdline processing in separate script
    - added the '-d, --confdir=path' option
    - added "--nodebootstrap": Skip debootstrap, only do configuration
      to the target
    - add -v, --verbose: Increase verbosity
    - do not create stage file at finalize()
  * Edit /etc/network/interfaces as well if the file exists already,
    we definitely need at least a loopback interface.
  * Adjust postfix configuration:
    - modify hostname related options in /etc/postfix/main.cf
    - listen on loopback interface by default (thanks for suggestion, gebi)
  * Unify the --bootappend option, it's not --boot_append (thanks for
    the hint, Tong Sun).
  * Support execution of further scripts via options --scripts and
    --chroot-scripts.
  * Drop locales from RECONFIGURE list (thanks for hint, Tong Sun).
